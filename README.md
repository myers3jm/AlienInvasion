# AlienInvasion
A simple game using Python's pygame library.

To play the game, one needs to have Python installed (preferably the latest version). With Python installed on the machine, simply run "alien_invasion.pyw."

To move the spaceship use the 'A' and 'D' keys to go left and right, respectively, and the spacebar to fire. Holding the spacebar enables continuous fire.

The number of remaining spaceships is shown in the upper left corner, the top score in the middle, and the current player's score at the right.

Upon losing, the player may enter their name to be recorded in "scores.py." The highest score from this file is displayed as the high score.

The objective is to stay alive for as long as possible, and that means killing xenomorphs.

TODO:
- Add variations to wave patterns so that holding spacebar doesn't work anymore
- Add alien weapons/abilities
- Add barriers near player for protection from alien attacks
- Consider implementing player weapons-cooldown
- Add weapons upgrades
- Add extra lives
- Add music
- Add in-app options menu
- Restore fullscreen option and link to control in the in-app options menu
- Add new spaceships
- Add new aliens
